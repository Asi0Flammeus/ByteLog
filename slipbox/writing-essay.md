1. Remember
2. Understand
3. Applying
4. Analyse
5. Evaluating
6. Creating

And you know what? Writing an esay forces you to use extensively stage 4, 5 and 6.
Therefore and because we, as individual, are the most easiest to fool with our own knowledge -- [ wink R.Feynman ](https://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/1bjaijn/the_first_principle_is_that_you_must_not_fool/) -- we can only prove that we properly a concept (or a set of concepts) if we can create with it, and crafting an essay is a humble way to do it.

Plus, it will forces you to go deep into the subject, and if you publish them you are additionally using a bias to your advantage -- as your ego would be engage into it and requires you to do your best because others might read your stuff, though be careful to not become obscessed with perfection (which can't be attainable).
