> Don't wish Vim was easier, wish you were better! (p.6)

As the creator of Vim, Bram Moolenaar puts it:

> Learning to drive a car takes effort. Is that a reason to keep driving a bicycle? No, you realize you need to invest time to learn a skill. Text editing isn't different. You need to learn new commands and turn them into habit.

- to learn this new habit, we can't rely on sole motivation and will-power, simply because there are not reliable for long term discipline.
  - instead use "mini-habits", like
    - pass a moment daily on practicing new commands that corresponds to you need
    - keep a reccord of what is difficult to do in vim, and do from time to time some drilling exercice on it.
    - personnaly, I use nvim as my principal and only editor so I have to use it every single time I want to write a note or code.
      - here the underlying principle is use meaningful friction to incite you to practice your new habit.
