# Code Challenges

Since I have heard multiple times that one can use LLMs such as chatgpt to help us learning effectively, I will, when learning new concepts in programming, to provide 3 challenges of increasing difficulty to wrap my head over the concepts

Here's the generic prompt used:

```
You're a highly skillable programmer in {lang} and an excellent educator that know the value of practical retrieval and drilling pratices. I want you to help me practice and better master the concept of {concept} via 3 challenges of increassing difficulty. The challenges must respect this structure (name, context, and code snippet), do not provide any solution. Output should only be the challenges.

---
# challenge I: name
## Context
## Code Snippet

```

It could be useful to create a simple `py` script that call the openai api to create folder and subfolder for any given concept in some language.
But now, as I'm only testing this mastering technique I will simply use the WebUI and copy paste.
