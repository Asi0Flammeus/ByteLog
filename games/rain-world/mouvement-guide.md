Here the commands are represent by the initial letters:

- `u`, up arrow
- `d`, down arrow
- `l`, left arrow
- `r`, right arrow
- `o`, opposite directio
- `j`, jump (`b` key)
- `g`, grab (`y` key)
- `t`, throw (`a` key)

If the letter is uppercase then it has to be hold

## Leap Jump

To jump through a leap

```
d + J + release when charged
```

## Store items

- all small non eatable items can be stored in the belly with `G`

## turn around in tunnel

```
L (or R) + j
```

## Half turn

- switch direction after walking for two tiles
- it would give small boost

## Backflip

- build speed (2 tiles)
- `o + j`

## Roll

- when falling do `D + L/R`
- to roll fast make a 45 degree angle
- if you jump at the end of the 2nd rool you will pounce and be able to roll indefinitely
- use audio cues to time your mouvement

## horizontal boost

- jump while throwing a stone or spear gives horizontal momentum
  - can be useful to jump further

## corner boost

- in tunnel at corner you can (j + hold direction) to gain momentum

## pipe boost

- jump when coming out of a pipe gives boost
- helpful to reach pole

## coyote leap

- when leaving an ledge you can jump mid-air to go further

## thorwing downward

- press t when holding d while doing the backflip- can pin a creature like this (not for long)
- can embed spear and use them as pole
- can do the same but upward

## Turn Momentum

- when triggering a half-turn, keep momentum by timming jumping for 8 jumps on flat terrains

## slide

- press `j + d + L/R`
- all have to be pressed at the same time but only the direction button held
- you can pounce if you jump during the slide
- when sliding you can throw and it will ricochet
  - the physics of the ricochet has to be practiced

## mouth spearing

- throw while being crouch (d)

## corpse fling

- when coliding with large corpse you pres and hold all 3 action keys

## Den boosting

- den is pipe you can't go through
- if one is next to a wall you can get a jump boost
  - `hold d+l/r` in the direction of the wall and jump
